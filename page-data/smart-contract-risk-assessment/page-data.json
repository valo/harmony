These protocols allow to deposit funds, that are being lend out and the borrowers pay interest on the loans. The interest is paid back to the\\nliquidity providers of the protocol.

The frequency of claiming the rewards is determined by the gas costs of claiming them. Each transaction on the Ethereum blockchain costs money and in cases of high congestion these taxes are quite high. I usually recommend not to spend more than 5-10% of the claimed rewards in gas costs. That means that if the transaction cost for claiming the rewards, selling them and reinvesting is $10 in gas costs, the size of the claimed rewards should be at least $100-200 in order to be worth it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The above rule will yield different frequency of claiming the rewards.

One very simple strategy is to sell them for some stablecoin like $USDC. Another is to buy more of the token you farm with and stake them into the farm. A third option is to convert them to $ETH. The decision what to do with the farmed rewards is determined by your investment thesis and your general strategy.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Conclusion\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yield farming has evolved a lot in 2020. Personally I was not expecting the yield opportunities to continue for so long, but it looks like there are more and more DeFi projects being rolled out. All of these projects are competing for liquidity and in many cases offering rewards for the people willing to put their funds in them. As you navigate the universe of opportunities, don't forget to keep in mind the above points. Try to be level headed about the levels of risk you are taking. Keep in mind that many of these opportunities are zero-sum games, so if someone is winning, someone else is losing money.
